- Android runtime development


## ‚≠ê Highlights

The D-Guard Speaker Recognition System is a full-stack production solution for voiceprint recognition that achieves SOTA results on many public speech datasets. It is lightweight, easy to install, easy to use, and well-documented.


**Please note:**
1. The project is **still under development**, and the models have not been open-sourced.
2. This project has borrowed extensively from the code of [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain), [3D-Speaker](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/3D-Speaker), [FunASR](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR), and [WeSpeaker](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker).
